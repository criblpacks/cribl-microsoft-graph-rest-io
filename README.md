# Microsoft Graph REST Collector IO
----
## About this Pack
This pack is built as a complete SOURCE + DESTINATION solution (identified by the IO suffix). Data collection and delivery happen entirely within the pack's context, eliminating the need to connect it to globally defined Sources and Destinations. 

This Pack is designed to collect, process, and output Microsoft Azure Graph data via the Azure Graph REST API. It currently supports the following endpoints:
* [Azure (MSEntra) Signins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/signin-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
* [Azure User Details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
* [Azure Device Details]()
* [Azure Security Alerts V2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/security-list-alerts_v2?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
* [Legacy Azure Security Alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/alert-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) - deprecated and will be [***removed*** April 2026](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&viewFallbackFrom=graph-rest-v1.0&preserve-view=true#alerts)

The Pack includes OCSF and Splunk output processing. OCSF data is mapped to the following Classes:
* Azure Signins - [Authentication [3002] Class](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.4.0/classes/authentication)
* Azure User Details - [User Inventory Info [5003] Class](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.4.0/classes/user_inventory)
* Azure Device Details - [Device Inventory Info [5001] Class](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.4.0/classes/inventory_info)
* Azure Alerts (all) - [Detection Finding [2004] Class](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.4.0/classes/detection_finding)

Splunk data is mapped to the following sourcetypes - these are the sourcetypes used by the [Splunk Add on for Microsoft Azure](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3757):
* Azure Signins: `sourcetype=azure:aad:signin`
* Azure Users: `sourcetype=azure:aad:user`
* Azure Device Details:`sourcetype=azure:aad:device`
* Legacy Azure Alerts: `sourcetype=ms:graph:security:alerts`
* Azure Alerts V2: `sourcetype=ms:graph:security:alerts:v2`


## Deployment

* This pack is configured by default to use the Worker Group's *Default Destination*.
* To use the *Default Destination*: No changes are required. The pack will route the data to the destination currently set as the Default on the Worker Group.
* To use a different Destination: You must update the pack's routes to specify your desired Destination.
* For immediate functionality without requiring Pack route filter expression modifications, every bundled Source within this pack adds a hidden field: `__packsource`. This field allows for seamless routing based on the Pack source.

### Configure the Collectors
* Obtain a ```Tenant ID```, ```Client ID``` and ```Client Secret``` from your Azure/Microsoft Entra Administrator. These credentials must have the following permissions in order for all the Collectors to work:
  * AuditLog.Read.All
  * Device.Read.All
  * Policy.Read.All
  * SecurityAlert.Read.All
  * SecurityEvents.Read.All
  * User.Read.All
* Add the ```Tenant ID```, ```Client ID``` and ```Client Secret``` to each Collector.
* Perform a Run > Preview to verify that each Collector works correctly.
* Schedule the Collectors and adjust the schedule as needed. Collectors requiring State Tracking should already have it enabled. Default schedules for each are:
   *  Signins: Every 5 minutes with default State Tracking
   *  Alerts: Every 5 minutes with default State Tracking
   *  Users: Once/day - this endpoint is configured to retrieve all available Users so keep that in mind.
   *  Devices: Once/day - this endpoint is configured to retrieve all available Devices so keep that in mind.

### Configure Output Format

Each data type can be configured to output data in either normalized JSON (default), OCSF, or Splunk (`_raw` + Splunk fields) format. Enable *only one* format for each of the following pipelines:
* ```cribl_azure_graph_signins```
* ```cribl_azure_graph_users```
* ```cribl_azure_graph_devices```
* ```cribl_azure_graph_alerts```
* ```cribl_azure_graph_alerts_v2```

### Configure your Destination/Update Pack Routes
To ensure proper data routing, you must make a choice: retain the current setting to use the Default Destination defined by your Worker Group, or define a new Destination directly inside this pack and adjust the pack's route accordingly.

### Commit and Deploy
Once everything is configured, perform a Commit & Deploy to enable data collection.

### Variables

The Pack has the following variables:
* `azure_graph_default_splunk_index`: Default index for the Splunk output - defaults to `azure`.

## Upgrades

Upgrading certain Cribl Packs using the same Pack ID can have unintended consequences. See [Upgrading an Existing Pack](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/packs#upgrading) for details.
